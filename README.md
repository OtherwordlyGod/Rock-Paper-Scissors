# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is the rock-paper-scissors project for The Odin Project.

In this project, I will write a simple logical function mainly using JavaScript that will 
take the input of a human choosing either rock, paper, or scissors and compare it with the computers
choice. rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. According to these 
postulates, the computer will then return a message and track your score of victories and losses.

This project will teach/familarize me the following: 

1. Creating a JavaScript project
2. How to write algorithms and pseudocode for a project
3. How to debug errors with the dev console
4. Improve my knowledge of JavaScript syntax

Reflection:

From this project, I familiarized myself with the workflow of writing JavaScript. I used an algorithm and pseudocode for the initial stages of the project and was able to run it relatively smoothly. The project was not particularily hard but there were a few moments where I had to craft an algorithm for a specific problem since the solution escaped me. This code is not the most efficient as it mostly relies of if statements. I googled a solution to this project as I was nearing the end just to ensure that I was on the right path. I took some things from the project such as the formatting of the code but the overall thought process was not copied. I used google to find the correct syntax for some of the issues that I was not the most familiar with such as for loops. Overall the project was a 4/10 for difficulty and has a lot of room for potential improvement such as adding a UI. There are a few bugs that do not affect the function of the project but are mostly quality of life issues and they have been marked with a comment. The credit from the code I took inspiration from is commented in the code. I forgot to commit messages during the making of this project unfortunately. This is something that I must work on.
