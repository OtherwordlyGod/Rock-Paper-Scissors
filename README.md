# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is the rock-paper-scissors project for The Odin Project.

In this project, I will write a simple logical function mainly using JavaScript that will 
take the input of a human choosing either rock, paper, or scissors and compare it with the computers
choice. rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. According to these 
postulates, the computer will then return a message and track your score of victories and losses.

This project will teach/familarize me the following: 

1. Creating a JavaScript project
2. How to write algorithms and pseudocode for a project
3. How to debug errors with the dev console
4. Improve my knowledge of JavaScript syntax
